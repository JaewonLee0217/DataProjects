# Prophet model
1. Single variable model
- DB is private and data forms are int(255)
- Change DB to yours to fit the model
- ds: date  yhat: predicted value  yhat_lower: predicted value low  yhat_upper: predicted value high in 95% range
- Black line is the actual data, blue line is predicted data, sky blue color range is the range in 95% accuracy

2. Multivariable model
- Using other varible that affects cost data prediction
